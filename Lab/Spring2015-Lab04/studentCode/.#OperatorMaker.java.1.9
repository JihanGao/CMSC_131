	 * It accomplishes this by calling the appropriate
	 * helper method and passing the grid into that.	
	 * 
	 * All of the methods are static and have a parameter of
	 * type SquareGrid.
	 *

	 * by making use of grid.getHt() to find out the size
	 * of the SquareGrid that was passed in.

	 * The helper methods you need to write are indicated below.

	 * You may add more helper methods if you want, but they 
	 * all need to be static as well.	
	 * 
	 * You will be using for loops here but you should also
	 * think about how one helper method might be able to make
	 * use of calling other helper methods that you have written.
	 * 
	 * In addition to the getHt() method, you'll be using the setColor
	 * method.  The way you'll use this will appear similar to
	 *    grid.setColor(row, column, Color.BLUE);
     * where you'll indicate the correct row and column and this 
     * line of code would then set that position in the grid to be
     * the color blue.
     * 
	 * Start by implementing the minus helper and testing that on
	 * your computer and on the submit server, then move on to each 
	 * remaining symbol in turn.
	 * 
	 * To run the program on your computer, you'll need to open the
	 * ExampleDriver.java file and run from there.  You do not change
	 * that file in any way.  All changes are done in this file.
